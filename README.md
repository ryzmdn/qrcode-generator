# QR Code Generator

The QR code generator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web application that allows users to generate QR codes dynamically directly from their browser. The generated QR codes can contain various types of data, such as text, URLs, contacts, locations, and more.

## Features

- Working link
- Can be scanned
- Can be reused for your website

## How does it work?

- **Users input data**: they want to convert into a QR code through a form or input field.
- **Processing**: JavaScript takes the input data and uses a specific library or function to convert it into a visual representation in the form of a QR code.
- **Creating HTML Elements**: JavaScript then creates HTML elements (usually ```<img>``` or ```<canvas>```) to display the generated QR code.
- **Styling with CSS**: CSS is used to customize the appearance and style of the QR code, such as its size, color, and position on the page.
